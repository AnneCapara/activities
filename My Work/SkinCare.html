    <h1>Simple Steps to the Best Daily Skincare Routine, According to Dermatologists</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        So you want to start a <span class="tag">skincare</span> routine, but you have some questions: How many
        skincare products do you have to
        use? Which ones are right for your skin? In what order should you be applying these products? And what do the
        products even do?
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the most benefit out of daily skincare <span class="tag">regimen</span>, no matter what your skin type,
        you should start with
        three simple steps: cleanse, treat and moisturize, recommends Ashley Magovern, M.D., dermatologist and owner and
        founder of Manhattan Dermatology in Manhattan Beach, California. You're probably already familiar with cleansing
        and moisturizing, but what does "treating" your skin involve?
    </p>
    <p>
        It means using serums or creams packed full of skincare ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, alpha hydroxy acids
        and others, depending on your skin type and the results you want to see, she explains. "Adding a middle step in
        between the cleansing and moisturizing components is really important," Dr. Magovern says. "It can make a huge
        difference over time and in the health, appearance and aging of your skin."
    </p>

    <h2>Your Morning Skincare Routine</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>1. Cleanser</h3>
    <p id="cleanser">
        Face cleansing should be the first step in any skincare routine, as it clears away impurities and excess oil
        that can clog pores and dull skin. But be gentle. “Too many people cleanse too much or too often or with a
        cleanser that’s too harsh, which will actually break down your skin’s protective barrier,” Dr. Magovern says. If
        you have dry or sensitive skin, try washing only at night and rinsing your face with water in the morning.

    <h3>2. Toner</h3>
    <p id="toner">
        You don’t need a toner, but swiping one on can be a great way to refresh skin, remove any residual debris and
        balance pH, Dr. Magovern says. If you have acne-prone skin, look for a toner with ingredients like salicylic
        acid to combat breakouts. For dry or sensitive skin, seek out a hydrating toner (or its sister, an essence) made
        without parching alcohol and with ingredients like glycerin and hyaluronic acid to soothe.
    </p>

        alt="toner">
    <h3>3. Serum</h3>
    <p id="serum">
        A serum tailored to your skin concerns can both treat and protect. Look for an antioxidant, like gold-standard
        vitamin C. “Everyone should use vitamin C, no matter what age,” Dr. Magovern says. “It helps reverse a lot of
        the skin damage we get from the sun and pollution.” For darker skin tones, hyperpigmentation can be a common
        issue, and using a vitamin C serum in the morning can help mitigate dark spots, says Jennifer David, D.O., a
        dermatologist in Philadelphia and founder of Skin & Scripts Virtual Dermatology.

        alt="serum">
    <h3>4. Eye Cream</h3>
    <p id="eyecream">
        Eye creams fall into the "treat" category, too. If desired, lightly tap on a formula targeted to your eye-area
        concerns, using your ring finger (your weakest) to avoid tugging on delicate skin and causing damage.
    </p>

        alt="eyeCream">
    <h3>5. Moisturizer</h3>
    <p id="moisturizer">
        Next come heavier formulas like moisturizer, which keeps skin hydrated and helps strengthen its barrier. Unless
        you have dry skin, opt for a lighter moisturizer for daytime use, such as a lotion or gel that will soak in
        quickly and won’t pill under makeup. If your skin is drier, try a thicker formula, like a cream. “Look for
        ceramides or hyaluronic acid, since these ingredients are the building blocks of moisture retention in skin,”
        Dr. David explains.
    </p>

        alt="moisturizer">
    <h3>6. Sunscreen</h3>
    <p id="sunscreen">
        It’s the most important step in any skincare routine, for every skin type and age. “If you don’t wear sunscreen,
        you might as well not do any of the other steps,” Dr. Magovern says. “The sun is the number one reason people’s
        skin ages prematurely.” And the damage isn’t only cosmetic, no matter what your skin color: “People of color can
        and do get skin cancer,” Dr. David says. “Plus, if you’re treating hyperpigmentation without daily SPF use, it’s
        like taking two steps forward and one step backward.”
    </p>
    <p id="sunscreen">
        Smooth on a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher face sunscreen as the last step in your morning skincare routine,
        including on your neck and the backs of your hands. Heads up: Protecting your skin from the sun is important
        even if you're spending your days indoors, as UV rays can penetrate through the windows.
