    <p>
        Civilizations around the world have been celebrating the start of each new year for at least four millennia.
        Today, most New Year’s festivities begin on December 31 (New Year’s Eve), the last day of the Gregorian
        calendar, and continue into the early hours of January 1 (New Year’s Day). Common traditions include attending
        parties, eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the new year and watching fireworks displays.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Year’s Day is observed by most countries worldwide on January 1st, the first day of the New Year, following
        both the Gregorian and the Julian calendar. The New Year is often marked by fireworks, parades, and reflection
        upon the last year while looking ahead to a New Year of future possibilities. Many people celebrate the New Year
        in the company of loved ones, observing traditions meant to bring luck and success in the upcoming year. Many
        Cultures celebrate in their own unique way. Typically, the customs and traditions of involve celebrating with
        champagne and a variety of different foods. New Years marks a date of happiness and a clean slate. For many
